This repository contains a package for interacting with the
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) API.

Right now I am focused on DNS record updates, so I've included the API requests
for this purpose only.

There is also a program using the package, cfiupdate, which allows you to
update a specific A record.
